We're starting a new startup and we don't have a name yet but you may suggest one name
and fill it in.
The heading could be supermarkets are making us sick and the bigger picture here is that
we want to make a startup where we give easy access to information that helps people locally
to make their own food and the idea is that supermarkets of course create all these processed
foods and make it very easily accessible to everybody and distribute that in a very easy
way and it's so easy that we the people have forgotten to create our own resources to independently
create food and this is not only a problem in the first world but in third world countries
it's even worse because there is no access to information and this supermarket is trying
to sell people that almost have no money very expensive food and they cannot sometimes have
food every day so this is a very foundational problem in society because all these processed
foods and sugars are making people sick and they are still doing it because it's too easy
and it's still the easiest way because that's what people teach us if you get a job if you
make money you can buy food and that's how people think the world works now and that
is how the world largely works now but we can actually make food ourselves and there's
no educational system that gets there's no commercial system to get that does teach
this to people because they would not get rewarded for it because it creates independence
not commercially viable so that's why we need to do this because we don't care about it
being commercially viable we care about it's solving a huge pain it solves the problem
of the world becoming sick and indoctrinated by supermarkets and of rent I think the landing
page however should especially reflect this ideology the landing page should definitely
say more about how the system works and now I will tell you a bit more on how the initial
proof of concept MVP could work it could simply be a base model AI chatbot that you talk to
where it will first figure out your current personal situation so it will ask you how
big is your garden how big is your land how big is your house and how much space do you
have to do something with electricity how big is your garden that has sun what location
do you live in what is the climate there this climate can be gathered through APIs of course
that doesn't need to be input by the user however the user needs to input the location
or at least we need to gather the location from the IP address and then we need to know
like how much land and how much space they have right that's the most important and then
with APIs and with information from the internet we can figure out automatically where to buy
what and what is the demand in the neighborhood of where the person lives or in the cities
in the in the area and what is easy on the market to buy like seeds like how can you
get started doing this so how can you migrate as much as possible to a situation where that
person in his garden is growing part of their own food like for free right and then basically
our goal is to make that easier than the supermarket and if we succeed then a lot more people will
be doing this and getting out of the system the matrix that we are in right now and that's
the goal and and this will make the world un-sick you know themselves and do you want
to add something Bruna? I think it's great, I think we have a lot of people in the internet already explaining
how to plant how to plant in a small area into the apartment into your garage you don't need a
big garden you don't need a huge land to do that so we we have this knowledge that's not being
shared and it would be great to be to have it in a platform or in our in our data and share it
or and maybe put these people together these people that already talk about food and we could
create a community with these people or give people a mentor like give people a access to a
network of educators that already know perfectly like what to do and how to make things better
you know give them the right access to the right people and information yes based on location and
also for the internet but mostly for the poor people the location matters a lot
and also
these kind of people they are a little bit different from the capitalist people
mindsets of people in the world they think about food they think about the others and they
they seem like very kind people that want to come to share this kind of knowledge so
they probably most of them would love to volunteer for a better world and
yeah i don't know it's great don't throw it away please pick scent very carefully yeah
i think that's it for now

Make the header super big (100pt), make the landing page nature-like, natural font,
add no api management url or settings or share buttons

use a SVG pattern that looks like a green leaf
the content should be in glassmorphism cards, the header
