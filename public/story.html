            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Genesis of Our Idea</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Our journey began with a simple question: "What's too easy in the world that should be harder?" The
                answer was right in front of us: supermarkets. They're convenient, yes, but at what cost to our health?
            </p>
            <p>
                We realized that the ease of shopping at supermarkets often leads us to make unhealthy choices. It's
                human nature to opt for convenience, even when it's not in our best interest. This realization sparked
                our mission: to make accessing local, healthy food as easy as shopping at a supermarket.
            </p>

        <div class="glassmorphism text-black mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Vision</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                We envisioned a platform that connects people directly with local farmers and food suppliers. Our goal
                is to eliminate the need for individuals to independently seek out multiple local sources, which can be
                time-consuming and challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
                By bringing diverse resources together in one place, we aim to make it incredibly easy for people to
                transition to a healthier lifestyle. We believe that with the right infrastructure, choosing local,
                healthy food can become just as convenient as shopping at a supermarket.
            </p>

        <div class="glassmorphism text-black mb-8">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Unique Approach</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
                What sets us apart is our commitment to transparency and fair practices. We operate on a flat fee model
                - just â‚¬1 per user per month. The rest of your fixed budget goes directly to the farmers. We don't
                handle this money; our role is to facilitate the connection and ensure smooth delivery from farm to your
                doorstep.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our platform provides you with all the information you need to make informed purchases, whether it's
                monthly or weekly. We're not driven by profit, but by a genuine desire to improve community health and
                support local agriculture.
            </p>
